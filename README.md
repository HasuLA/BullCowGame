# BullCowGame
## Concept
Simple console word-guessing game. 
## Rules
Player sets a desireble word-length. 
Player has limited guesses he can make. 
Word is always an isogram. 
The longer the isogram length is, the more guesses limit player has. 

Game should be played in lower case, otherwise player will be warned
After each guess, the game tells user how close to the answer he gets: Cows count means how many letters was correctly guessed, Bulls count means how many letters on correct positions was guessed. 
If player guesses the word till he ran out of guesses limit - he wins.
